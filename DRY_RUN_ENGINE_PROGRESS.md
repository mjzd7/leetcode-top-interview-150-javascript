# Dry-Run Engine — Progress Ledger

**Plan of record:** [`DRY_RUN_ENGINE_PLAN_v5.md`](DRY_RUN_ENGINE_PLAN_v5.md) (v5.1).
This file records progress against it. Nothing here is authoritative; the plan is.

**Rules, non-negotiable:**

1. **Append-only.** Never rewrite history — a superseded line gets `~~struck~~`, not deleted.
2. **One append per row, in the same commit as the row's code.** A row whose evidence
   is missing here is *not done*, regardless of what the chat said.
3. **Every number cites a command.** No number enters this file that `npm run audit`
   or a shell one-liner cannot reproduce.
4. **A row with no test id in §5 is a hole**, visible on sight.

## 1. Baseline (measured 2026-10-02, before any row ran)

| Fact | Value | Reproduce with |
|---|---|---|
| Guides | 150 | `npm run validate` |
| Runtime-tested | 109 | `npm test` |
| **Syntax-only (never executed)** | **41** | `npm test` |
| Syntax blocks checked | 450 | `npm test` |
| Runtime assertions | 828 | `npm test` |
| ` ```javascript ` fences (unfiltered) | 813 | `grep -c '```javascript'  **/*.md` |
| `Level 3` headings | 153 | audit (row 0) |
| `### Step-by-Step Dry Run` tables | 453 | audit (row 0) |
| Sandbox envelope slot | 1 MB — overflow **drops** the envelope | `grep -n ENVELOPE_MAX_CHARS api/_lib/sandbox.mjs` |
| Sandbox timeout / heap | 3 s / 16 MB | `sed -n '96,98p' api/_lib/sandbox.mjs` |
| Judge pilot registry | 5 hardcoded slugs · codec whitelist `['json','tree']` | `grep -n 'PILOT_SLUGS\|codec' api/_lib/problems.mjs` |
| Playwright projects | `desktop` 1440×900 + `Pixel 7` | `grep -n 'name:' playwright.config.mjs` |
| Guide bundle size | 20 KB / 556 lines per guide | audit (row 0) |
| `docs/curriculum-data.js` | 3.09 MB, gitignored | `ls -la docs/curriculum-data.js` |
| `api/_lib/kv.mjs` | exists, 73 lines, degrades `{ok:false}` — **reuse, never rewrite** | `wc -l api/_lib/kv.mjs` |
| `eval` / `new Function` in guides | 0 | audit (row 0) |
| `async`/`generator` inside solution regions | 0 (159 lines live in §6 follow-ups) | audit (row 0) |
| `Math.random` / `Date` in guides | 3 | audit (row 0) |

The 41 syntax-only guides are the whole point of W-1. They have never been executed.

### 1.1 Row 0 re-measurement — 16 drifts, none absorbed

`npm run audit` measured the §1 baseline against the repo on 2026-10-02 at `633931e`.
**16 asserted numbers do not hold.** They are printed as a DRIFT table, not corrected
in the script. Three change what a later row must do:

| Asserted | Measured | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `eval`/`new Function` in guides = 0 | **0** ✓ | K7 invariant holds |
| async/generator lines inside solution regions = 0 | **1** | `08-linked-list/02-add-two-numbers.md:141` — the word `yield` in a *prose comment* (`// zero must yield one node`), not code. Row 4's `sg` scan is AST-shaped and correctly does **not** flag it. The plan's "0 lines" was right about code and wrong about raw text. |
| async/generator lines in follow-ups = 159 across 70 guides | **188 across 72** | risk is larger than the plan recorded, still bounded |
| `RUNTIME_TESTS` = 109 keys, 81 `fns`+`cases` / 28 `script` | **56 / 53** | the 81/28 split is wrong by 25/25. **Row 2 drops `fns` from 56 entries, not 109.** |
| thin tables = 22 in 19 guides (2 empty) | **27 in 23 guides (3 empty)** | **row 21 and row 29 have 5 more tables to repair than the plan assumed.** All 23 named in the audit output. |
| ` ```javascript ` fences = 813 | **807** | the 813 figure counted fences outside the 150-guide set |
| `Level 3` headings = 153 · 4-field header = 151 | **150 · 150** | earlier counts included non-guide files |
| dry-run tables = 453 | **450** | ditto — 453 was never 150-guide-only |
| `Map`/`Set` = 64 · `Math.random`/`Date` = 3 | **64 · 3** ✓ | serializer scope (E5) is right |
| typed arrays = 19 · BigInt literals = 14 | **23 · 15** | E6 scope larger than recorded |
| self-recursive guides = 87–152 | **78–85** | heuristic is pinned in the script; the old range was wider than reality |
| guide size = 20 KB / 556 lines | **16.5 KB / 430 lines** | |
| guides / 450 blocks / 109 / 41 / 828 | **150 / 450 / 109 / 41 / 828** ✓ | the numbers rows 3 and 7 build on all hold |

Row 3's kill criterion (**>15 wrong of 41**) is unaffected — that measures execution
failures, not counts. Nothing in this table blocks row 3.

---

## 2. Scope

**Deliverable: the 150 guides already in this repo.** Expansion to the full catalogue
is probable but not current — §8 of the plan is a *gated* track, dark until its trigger
fires. Owner decision, 2026-10-02.

## 3. Task table — 34 rows + 3 gated

One atomic action per row. `Evidence` is the receipt; empty means not done.

**Gated — do not build unprompted.**

|---|---|---|

## 4. Decision log — all closed 2026-10-02

| # | Decision | Answer | Reopen by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Anonymous dry runs | yes — read-only, 10/min, cached (binds T-a only) | editing this row |
| 2 | Animate all 3 levels? | all 3 for Tier 1, canonical only for Tier 2 | |
| 3 | Goldens: KV or static JSON? | **static JSON under `docs/`** | |
| 4 | Server QuickJS or browser tracer? | server, custom-input only (T-a) | |
| 5 | Trace user-submitted code? | **no — canonical only, permanently** | **security**; needs new design + threat model |
| 6 | Degraded interview mode | opt-in | |
| 7 | Prediction score storage | localStorage; aggregates → `kv.mjs` | |
| 8 | Premium problems | **link-only, own wording, never reproduce** | **licensing** |

## 5. Edge-case coverage — E1–E36 → test id

A row with no test id is a hole. `—` means the test does not exist yet.

| Group | Cases | Enforcing script | Test ids |
|---|---|---|---|
| Serialization / golden stability | E1 `undefined` · E2 `NaN`/`±Infinity` · E3 `-0` vs `0` · E4 `BigInt` · E5 `Map`/`Set` · E6 typed arrays · E7 cycle/shared ref · E8 key order · E9 depth > 10 000 | `test:trace` (row 6) | — |
| Instrumentation correctness | E10 recursive target · E11 class methods · E12 callbacks inside target · E13 same-block helper · E14 other-block helper · E15 IIFE/arrow/getter · E16 async/generator · E17 `eval`/`new Function` · E18 step throws · E19 guide edited after goldens | `test:trace` (7,9,10,20) · `validate` (4) | — |
| Budget / resource | E20 trace > 1 MB · E21 single chunk > slot · E22 heap blowup · E23 > 200 k steps · E24 3 s timeout · E25 16 MB OOM | `test:trace` (11,12) · `test:judge` (existing) | — |
| Correctness / determinism | E26 `Math.random`/`Date` · E27 random-jump ≡ forward walk · E28 six equivalence kinds · E29 input validation | `test:trace` (14,26) · `npm test` (19) | — |
| Scale-only (T1–T3, dark) | E30 path-keyed registry · E31 65 MB bundle · E32 golden footprint · E33 600 k execs · E34 authored tables · E35 derived equivalence · E36 premium | assertions inside the generators | n/a — track dark |

## 6. Kill-criterion counters

| Criterion | Threshold | Current | Fires when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **W-1** wrong canonicals among the 41 | **> 15** | **not yet measured** | row 3 completes |
| W0 oracle needs manual adjudication | > 25 % of equivalence kinds | n/a | row 19 |
| W2 static path adoption | < 10 users/week after a month | n/a | a month after W2 |
| T1 drafts failing adjudication twice | > 30 % | n/a | track dark |

## 7. Session log

### 2026-10-02 — row 0 done, and it found 16 wrong numbers

- `scripts/audit-curriculum.mjs` (`633931e`). `npm run audit` measures; `--check`
  self-verifies the K7 predicate; `--json` feeds rows 21/29.
- **The gate did its job.** 16 asserted counts in §1 do not hold. Recorded in §1.1.
  Three change a later row's shape: row 2 drops `fns` from **56** entries (not 109),
  rows 21/29 repair **27** thin tables in **23** guides (not 22/19), and row 4's `sg`
  scan is AST-shaped precisely because the one apparent "async line in a solution" is a
  prose comment.
- `npm run validate` and `npm test` unchanged throughout: 150 files, 109 runtime,
  41 syntax-only, 450 syntax blocks, 828 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors.

### 2026-10-02 — plan v5.1 opened

- Re-verified every load-bearing fact in §1 against the repo at `ab0a678`. All held;
  none re-litigated.
- Folded the v5.1 tooling deltas into the plan: §0.2 receipts (`jq 1.7.1`,
  `delta 0.19.2`, `sg 0.44.1`, Playwright's two configured projects, `firecrawl`),
  rows 2/4/6/13/25 reshaped, row 0b added, row 30 extended with the CI
  `cache: 'npm'` + time-budget risk.
- Closed all 9 owner decisions on defaults + 7 process decisions (§4).
- Scope set: 150 guides now, expansion gated (§2).
- **Next: row 0** — `scripts/audit-curriculum.mjs`.
